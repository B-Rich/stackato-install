Everything seems to have worked. You should now see a VirtualBox VM booting.
Watch the console screen and wait for the boot to finish. It may take several
minutes. When it is done the console screen should have a url like:

    https://stackato-xxxx.local

Load that url in a browser and continue your journey. Your next steps will be:

  * Fill out the setup screen
  * Go to the App Store tab
  * Install some interesting Apps
  * â™¥ Stackato

Enjoy!
